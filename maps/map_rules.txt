the map file must end with '.cub'
map must contain:
	1. map content in any order but before the actual map:
		- it must contain only this:
			- NO, SO, EA, WE textures for the walls in any order followed by the path of the texture (ex:NO ./path_to_texture)
			- F, C floor and ceiling colors followed by three colors in rgb from 0 to 255 (ex:C 255,30,0)
		- those parametters can contain or be separated by isspace/empty lines and still has to work
	2. the actual map:
		- it must be composed only of:
			- any number of 0 (empty space) and 1 (walls)
			- one letter of the following ones 'N,S,E,W' for the player start position
		- it must be closed, surrounded by walls
		- it can be shaped by spaces as long as they are not inside the surrounding walls
Any violation of previous rules must return an ERROR that has to display an explicit message


map parsing:
	1 - check that there is all the textures and store them
	2 - check that there is all the colors and store them
	3 - algorithm to check the actual map, only read after the bigger index of the previous parametters
